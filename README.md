Hey there! My pronouns are He/Him. I am a finance grad, programmer, and coffee enthusiast.

My main language is Python, but I've also done some work in Node.js, JavaScript and SQL. I'm always learning something new in the coding world, whether it be an entire language or an algorithm.

My largest project is FinMesh, a Python wrapper for IEX Cloud and a couple other financial data APIs. The rest of my projects are a mix of personal project, task automation, and backend stuff.

### What am I currently working on?
---

I am currently working on expanding and extending my machine learning theory and knowledge by implementing various algorithms from scratch in Python.
 
I'm also currently looking for career opportunities in the areas of finance, business analysis, data analysis, and backend programming.

Most of my repositories here will have a README that explains the idea behind the project. You can also find project summaries and my full resume on my personal website **[HERE](https://michaelphartmann.github.io/)**.

### How can you contact me?

I have a LinkedIn profile where I am active every day. Connect with me and send me a message, even if it's just to say hi! You can find that **[HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-hartmann/)**.
